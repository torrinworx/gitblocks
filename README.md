# GitBlocks

Version control lets you track changes, keep history, and collaborate safely. GitBlocks brings Git-backed datablock version control to Blender in a way that fits how Blender projects actually work.

Control the history and versioning of your `.blend` projects, see who changed what and when, revert changes, check out older versions, and merge or rebase updates, all from the Blender UI.

# How does it work?
Other Blender version control systems rely on storing full `.blend` copies or recording user inputs. Those methods are bulky, fragile, and make it hard to understand what actually changed.

GitBlocks uses Blender's datablock system. It serializes individual datablocks into JSON files, stores them in a Git repo, and deserializes them back into Blender when you check out a previous commit or reopen a project.

This runs alongside Blender's autosave without interfering with it, so you can keep autosave on and still get clean, reviewable history.

# Features
- Datablock-based diffs written as readable files.
- Stage or unstage individual changes or grouped updates.
- Commit from inside Blender with clear blockers when something is wrong.
- Check out older commits, switch branches, or create branches from commits.
- Merge and rebase with conflict resolution tools.

# Quick Start
1. Save your `.blend` file to a folder that will become the project root.
2. Open the **GitBlocks** panel in the 3D View sidebar.
3. Click **Init Repository** to initialize a Git/GitBlocks repo.
4. Make Blender changes; GitBlocks will write datablocks automatically.
5. Stage individual changes or groups from the panel.
6. Commit with a message.
7. Use **Checkout Commit** for a detached preview, or **Checkout Branch** to return to a branch.

# Install
1. Download the GitBlocks add-on (zip or folder).
2. In Blender: **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...**
3. Enable **GitBlocks**.
4. In the add-on preferences, click **Install Dependencies**.

> Legacy aliases remain in a few compatibility surfaces so existing workspaces and scripts keep working, but GitBlocks is the primary brand everywhere new users look.
